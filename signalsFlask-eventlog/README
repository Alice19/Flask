I have found logging events into the dbase as a big big headache. Although it is a important thing to have in your web app, but the job is n fact quite boring. All this now gets solved using the blinker library. You can read how the library functions on the blinker site , but here is how i implemented it in one of my app.

the file views.py has three functions:-
1.home
2.login
3.thelogger--this logs the events that occur in the above two functions..


'home' and 'login' funcs generate signals which are caught by 'thelogger' func and it just puts them in the dbase.And yes I am using GAE here but anything can be used
