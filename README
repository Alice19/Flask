(Meant for the Flask Framework)
This is a store which enables storing sessions on the server in a database and is meant for use on GAE.
The session id is saved as a cookie on the client and the sessiondata is saved in a column in the Table.

The Model class or the table has to be defined in GAE as follows:-
class MyNewSessionTable(db.Model):
    sessid=db.StringProperty(multiline=True)
    sessiondata=db.BlobProperty()

The store GAEsessions has to be pasted or imported into werkzeug.contrib.sessions 

After that go to your app and use it like I have used it in the __init__.py file . The init.py file contains the code written by hewew(on Flask mailing list) and Armin(the creator of flask)

Take care of the below
1.check for the presence of sessions using sessions.get('attributeorwhatever'), else a keyerror will be raised if the attribute is not present
